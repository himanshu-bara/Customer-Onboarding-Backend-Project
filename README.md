# Customer-Onboarding-Backend-Project
Built a microservices-based banking customer onboarding system covering registration, KYC, and account creation. Developed RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, integrated with Oracle DB, and documented using Swagger. Implemented Kafka for event-driven workflows, including automated email notifications for KYC rejection updates.
